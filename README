All of the source code is in NBPart1.py. It includes a main method that takes a csv file in the format provided and a random seed and uses them to create, train, and test a model using Naive Bayes. The rest is the NaiveBayes class which includes methods to train and test the model. As outpute, it creates a csv file containing a confusion matrix.

I affirm that I have adhered to the honor code on this assignment.
