## Naive Bayes Classifier

Perhaps the simplest kind of classifier: it counts up how many times each attribute corresponds to each category and uses those proportions to estimate what category something new is most likely to belong to.

NBPart1.py includes a main method that takes a csv file and uses it to create, train, and test a model using Naive Bayes. As output, it creates a csv file containing a confusion matrix.
